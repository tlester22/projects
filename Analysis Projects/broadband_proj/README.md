# Broadband Project

This is a project I did to explore the relationship between internet access and income.
I got all my data from the census website. Included is the Jupyter Notebook I used to import
and explore the data, the csv I exported for raw data viewing, and the report I wrote discussion my findings.

* Updated to include new import script with more columns, new csv data, and multivariable regression done using R.
