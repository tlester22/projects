# projects

This is a collection of projects I've worked on both in school and in my free time just to practice.
I've included some examples of programming, data analysis, data visualization, data manipulation,
database design and data modeling. I've used Python, SQL or Excel to accomplish these tasks. I've also 
included links to raw data.
